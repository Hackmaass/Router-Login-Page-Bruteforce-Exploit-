# Router-Login-Page-Bruteforce-Exploit-
Made this out of boredom to change the name of my school's WIFI SSID (name)
Could take help from you open source enthusiasts to make it perfect and more optimised 
I did know the the wifi password beforehand so that's something you should know and my code won't help you with it 
Used CUPP to make a password register to be used with the code, I did know some inner workings of my school so your social engineering skills are also needed..


# BruteForce MAC Changer

This project contains a Python script that performs a brute-force attack on a login form. After 5 failed attempts, the script changes the MAC address and continues the attack. The project can also work with password lists generated using CUPP (Common User Passwords Profiler).

## Features:
- Brute-force login attempts.
- Change MAC address after a defined number of failed attempts.
- Integration with CUPP for generating password lists.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `requests` module (install with `pip install requests`)
- `subprocess` module (built-in for handling system commands)
- Administrator/root privileges to change the MAC address.
- [CUPP (Common User Passwords Profiler)](https://github.com/Mebus/cupp) for password list generation.

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Set Up the Project

1. Clone or download the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bruteforce-mac-changer.git
    cd bruteforce-mac-changer
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

3. Create or edit the `passwords.txt` file in the project directory to include your password list. Each password should be on a new line.

    Example `passwords.txt`:
    ```
    password123
    admin
    qwerty
    123456
    letmein
    ```

### Step 2: Install and Use CUPP (Optional but Recommended)

CUPP (Common User Passwords Profiler) is a tool that generates custom password lists based on information you provide. You can use CUPP-generated passwords in this project.

#### Installing CUPP

1. Clone the CUPP repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git
    cd cupp
    ```

2. Run CUPP:
    
    ```bash
    python3 cupp.py -i
    ```

#### Using CUPP

1. CUPP will ask you a series of questions (like the target's name, birthdate, favorite things, etc.) to generate a customized password list.
2. After CUPP generates the password list, you can copy the generated file (e.g., `pass.txt`) to the root of your project directory as `passwords.txt`.

### Step 3: Running the Script

1. Modify the `TARGET_URL` in the script to match the login page you are targeting.
2. Place the CUPP-generated `passwords.txt` file or any other password list in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using:

    ```bash
    sudo python3 bruteforce_mac.py
    ```

    > Note: `sudo` is required because the script changes the MAC address, which requires administrative privileges.

### Step 4: MAC Address Management

The script automatically changes the MAC address after every 5 failed attempts. It uses the `ifconfig` command to bring down the interface, change the MAC, and bring it back up.

**Customizing the MAC Address Change:**

- By default, the script uses the `eth0` interface. If you're using a different network interface, replace `eth0` with the correct interface name in the `change_mac()` function.
- The MAC address is randomly generated. You can customize this behavior in the `change_mac()` function if you prefer a specific MAC address.

## Legal Disclaimer

This script is intended for ethical hacking, security research, and penetration testing. **Do not** use this script on systems you don't have permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

---

### Usage Summary:

- Use CUPP to generate personalized password lists.
- Modify the `TARGET_URL` and the network interface name as needed.
- Run the script and ensure that you have administrative privileges to change the MAC address.
