# Router-Login-Page-Bruteforce-Exploit-
Made this out of boredom to change the name of my school's WIFI SSID (name)
Could take help from you open source enthusiasts to make it perfect and more optimised 
I did know the the wifi password beforehand so that's something you should know and my code won't help you with it 
Used CUPP to make a password register to be used with the code, I did know some inner workings of my school so your social engineering skills are also needed..


# BruteForce MAC Changer

This project contains a Python script that performs a brute-force attack on a login form. After 5 failed attempts, the script changes the MAC address and continues the attack.

## Features:
- Brute-force login attempts
- Change MAC address after a defined number of failed attempts

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `requests` module (install with `pip install requests`)

## Usage:

1. Modify the `TARGET_URL` in the script to match the login page you're targeting.
2. Create a `passwords.txt` file with each password on a new line.
3. Run the script using:

    ```bash
    sudo python3 bruteforce_mac.py
    ```

Note: This script should only be used for ethical hacking and penetration testing with explicit permission.
